# Seconds Clock 
One of my first projects using Processing which creates a clock that counts the seconds.
<br>
Lots of room for improvement and flexability in functionality. For Example: 
<ul>
  <li>Adding a digital time counterpart</li>
  <li>Counting how many minutes have past</li>
  <li>Design improvement</li>
  <li>Add minutes hand</li>
</ul>
